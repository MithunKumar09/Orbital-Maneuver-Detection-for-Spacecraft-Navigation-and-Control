# Orbital Maneuver Detection

This project aims to detect orbital maneuvers based on variations in the semi-major axis (SMA) over time using a heuristic approach. The method identifies maneuvers such as engine burns or orbital adjustments by analyzing the SMA variations.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, maneuver detection, visualization, and evaluation.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for each module.
- `data/`: Folder to store the input data (SMA values).
- `results/`: Folder to store generated graphs and outputs.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis.

## How to Run

1. python main.py
